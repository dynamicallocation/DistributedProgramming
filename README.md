# Goals 
### Strengthen Understanding of Distributed Systems and its prevalency within Object Oriented Programming Languages
### Exhibit a better understanding of how Design Patterns can help create Dynamic API's i.e) State Management 
### Gain an understanding of how TDD(Test Driven Development) can be used to prevent edge cases
### An Understanding of how Asynchronity should be managed within a realtime application i.e) coordination of threads 


# Capabilities

## CRUD(Create Reuse Update Destroy) compliant functionality 

### Instructions 
### Upon Launching the program press a key correlating to three of the any five choices 
### 1:Add 2:Remove 3:Edit 
### After which you will be able to fill a form regarding the device you would like to instantiate/edit 
### Both Edit and Remove Utilize a unique ID the syncs with the index of the array list that manages it 
### Edit comes with 3 suboptions select suboption 1 to simply modify all sets of pre-existing value


## Dynamic State Management 

### Instructions 
### Upon Instantiating any number of devices Click 3 to edit 
### After which press sub Option 2 for an immediate state change and Option 3 for a delayed state change
### Note: Outlets are a special case by which a state for each of the 7 switches are instantiated. 
### These Switches can be turned both on and off independently of eachother but must be done so explicitly by the user

## Gradle Compliant 

### Instructions 
### The program itself is gradle Compliant. However due to some bugs running it is slightly different.  
### To run the program through gradle locate and change into the directory labeled "untitled" 
### After which enter the following command ./gradlew run --console=plain
### This will circumvent a bug caused with the gradle loading icon hanging when the program is already fully functional 

## Tests Through Gradle 

### Instructions 
### In the untitled directory(referenced above) enter the following command ./gradlew test 
### This will build only if all tests pass and helps to demonstrate the Test Driven nature of the program 

# Important 
## To reiterate its extremely important that if the user is running the program through gradle they use the following command
## ./gradlew run --console=plain
